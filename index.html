        From the events of the week across the country,<br> it has downed to me that leadership is a very important aspect for any country to develop.
        Over the years I had a privillage to serve the entire <br>fratanity of pharmacy students across the country,<br> in position of treasure and vice president.
        During this time i managed to learn alot of how pharmacy is being runned in the country. <br>From that point i learnt there is a lot of cracks in the system. <br> I started having questions of what can i do to influence change, afterall its either i be part of change or i stay quiet and see the sysytems in place continue crambling.
        One of the choices i opted for was embarcing all things TEC. <br> From there thats how i found my self wanting to pursue a career in software Engineering,<br> and guess who was the best option for that,,you guessed right Zindua School.
        And now here I am ready to be the change I pray and yearn for.
