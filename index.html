    <h3>
        From the events of the week across the country,<br> it has downed to me that leadership is a very important aspect for any country to develop.
       <br> Over the years I had a privillage to serve the entire <br>fratanity of pharmacy students across the country,<br> in position of treasure and vice president.
       <br> During this time I managed to learn alot of how pharmacy is being runned in the country. <br>From that point I learnt there is a lot of cracks in the system. <br> I started having questions of what can I do to influence change, <br> afterall its either I be part of change or I stay quiet and see the sysytems in place continue crambling.
       <br> One of the choices I opted for was embarcing all things TECH. <br> From there thats how I found my self wanting to pursue a career in software Engineering,<br> and guess who was the best option for that,you guessed right Zindua School.
       <br> And now here I am ready to be the change I pray and yearn for.
